### Stack Features and Skills for Algorithm Problems

**Features:**
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
- Useful for managing function calls, parsing expressions, and solving problems that require backtracking.
- Efficient for maintaining a temporary state or storing a history of operations.

**Skills to Handle Stack Problems:**
1. **Push and Pop Operations:** Master the basic stack operations to add elements (push) and remove elements (pop).
2. **Peek:** Ability to view the top element without removing it.
3. **Stack Implementation:** Understand how to implement a stack using arrays or linked lists.
4. **Balanced Parentheses:** Solve problems related to checking balanced parentheses using stacks.
5. **Reverse a String:** Use a stack to reverse a string efficiently.
6. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Apply stack for iterative DFS traversal in graphs.
7. **Backtracking:** Utilize stacks to implement backtracking algorithms efficiently.
8. **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluate postfix expressions using stacks.
9. **Next Greater Element:** Solve problems related to finding the next greater element using stacks.
10. **Monotonic Stack:** Understand and apply monotonic stack for specific problems.

By mastering these features and skills, you will be well-equipped to tackle algorithm problems involving stacks effectively on platforms like LeetCode.
