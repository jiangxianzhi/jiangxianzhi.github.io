### Stack Features and Skills for Binary Tree Algorithm Problems

**Features:**
- Can be used to simulate recursive function calls in an iterative manner.
- Useful for tree traversal algorithms like inorder, preorder, and postorder traversal.
- Helps in solving problems that require tracking parent nodes or backtracking in a tree structure.

**Skills to Handle Binary Tree Problems with Stack:**
1. **Inorder Traversal:** Implement iterative inorder traversal using a stack.
2. **Preorder Traversal:** Perform iterative preorder traversal using a stack.
3. **Postorder Traversal:** Solve problems by implementing iterative postorder traversal with a stack.
4. **Iterative Tree Construction:** Build a binary tree iteratively using a stack.
5. **Finding Paths:** Use a stack to find paths in a binary tree.
6. **Iterative Search:** Implement iterative search algorithms like DFS using a stack.
7. **Parent Node Tracking:** Maintain parent nodes while traversing a binary tree.
8. **Backtracking:** Utilize stacks for backtracking in tree-related problems.
9. **Expression Evaluation:** Evaluate expressions involving binary trees using stacks.
10. **Next Node in Inorder Successor:** Solve problems related to finding the next node in inorder traversal using stacks.

By mastering these features and skills, you will be well-prepared to tackle binary tree algorithm problems effectively on platforms like LeetCode using stacks.
