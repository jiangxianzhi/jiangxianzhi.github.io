### Linked List Features and Skills for Algorithm Problems

**Features:**
- Linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
- Useful for dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion and deletion operations, and representing data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
- Provides flexibility in managing data elements and handling problems that require sequential access.

**Skills to Handle Linked List Problems:**
1. **Node Manipulation:** Master the manipulation of linked list nodes, including insertion, deletion, and updating node values.
2. **Traversal:** Traverse through linked lists efficiently to access and process elements.
3. **Cycle Detection:** Detect cycles in linked lists using techniques like Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.
4. **Reversal:** Reverse a linked list iteratively or recursively.
5. **Merge Two Lists:** Merge two sorted linked lists efficiently.
6. **Middle Element:** Find the middle element of a linked list using fast and slow pointers.
7. **Intersection Detection:** Detect the intersection point of two linked lists.
8. **Dummy Nodes:** Understand and utilize dummy nodes for handling edge cases in linked list operations.
9. **Splitting:** Split a linked list into two parts based on a given condition.
10. **Palindrome Check:** Check if a linked list is a palindrome efficiently.

By mastering these features and skills, you will be well-prepared to tackle algorithm problems involving linked lists effectively on platforms like LeetCode.
