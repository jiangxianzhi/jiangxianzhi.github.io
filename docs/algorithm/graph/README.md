### Graph Features and Skills for Algorithm Problems

**Features:**
- Non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- Useful for modeling relationships, networks, and complex data structures.
- Provides a versatile framework for solving problems related to paths, cycles, connectivity, and traversal.

**Skills to Handle Graph Problems:**
1. **Graph Representation:** Understand and implement graph representations such as adjacency list, adjacency matrix, or edge list.
2. **Traversal Algorithms:** Master graph traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
3. **Shortest Path:** Solve shortest path problems using algorithms like Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford.
4. **Minimum Spanning Tree:** Understand and apply algorithms like Prim's or Kruskal's for finding minimum spanning trees.
5. **Topological Sorting:** Perform topological sorting of a graph efficiently.
6. **Cycle Detection:** Detect cycles in a graph using techniques like DFS or Union-Find.
7. **Connected Components:** Identify connected components in a graph using traversal algorithms.
8. **Graph Coloring:** Solve graph coloring problems efficiently.
9. **Eulerian Path/Cycle:** Understand and apply algorithms for finding Eulerian paths and cycles in a graph.
10. **Network Flow:** Handle network flow problems using algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson or Edmonds-Karp.

By mastering these features and skills, you will be well-equipped to tackle algorithm problems involving graphs effectively on platforms like LeetCode.
